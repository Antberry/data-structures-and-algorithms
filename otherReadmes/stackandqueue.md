# Stacks and Queues
Stacks is last in and first out, Queue is first in and first out.

## Challenge
Create Method for each to put value on, to take a value off, and to also look at the current value at the top of the stack or in front of the Queue.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O is (n), I approached it by locating the top node in Stack and Front and Last node in Queue.

## API
### STACK

### Pop - This method pops the top off and resign the top.
### Push - This method pushes a node onto the stack and resign the top as that new node.
### Peek - This method just see what is the current top node.

### QUEUE

### Dequeue - This method take off the Node in the front and resign the next node as the front Node.
### Queue - This method add a Node onto the back of the queue and resign the back Node as the new Node.
### Peek - This method just see which Node is the next in the Queue.
