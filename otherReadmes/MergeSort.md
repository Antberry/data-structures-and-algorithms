# Merge Sort

## Challenge
Implement an mergesort method to sort an array.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O is (n), I approached it by keep splitting each array until you cannot anymore than sort as you put it back together.

## API

### MergeSort
I implemented an method where it breaks down array divided by 2 until cannot repeat than sort array as it puts it back together.
