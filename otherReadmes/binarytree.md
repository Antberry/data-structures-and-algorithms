# Trees
A data structure that has a root node, left node, and right node.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Approach & Efficiency
I created a binary tree class with the methods I were instructed to create. PreOrder is root, left, right. Inorder is left, root, then right.
Post order is left, right ,then root.
