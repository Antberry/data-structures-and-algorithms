# Insert Sort

## Challenge
Implement an sort array.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O is (n), I approached it in by shifting values in place.

## API

### InsertSort
I implemented an method where it loops through an array and save the next value and see if it is smaller or larger than the previous value. If it is smaller it goes before and if it is bigger it stays in front of it.
