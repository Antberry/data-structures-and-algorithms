## Learning Objective

- Will learn how to sort an array using the merge sort method.

## Lecture Flow

- What is an array.
    - Array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.
- How to Merge Sort an array;
    - The idea is to keep breaking the array in half until you cannot break in half anymore. Then you want to sort it
    and merge it back together as you go.
    - test and empty array, array with duplicate numbers, and a many numbers unsorted numbers, and test a not equal sorted
    array.
